Node.JS is an event-driven, asynchrony javascript backend platform built upon Google's V8 engine.

# History of Node.JS

 - Created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and soon sponsered by Joyent
 - In 2011 NPM (Node Package Manager) was introduced to allow easier sharing of modules
 - Also in 2011, Microsoft and Joyent worked together to create a native Windows implementation of Node JS.
 - 2012 Dahl steps aside for NPM creator Isaac Schlueter to take over
 - 2014 Schlueter steps asside handing leadership over to Timothy Fontaine
 - At the end of 2014, io.js, a fork of Node.js, is created due to conflict with how Joyent was governing the platform. io.js main goal was to make governance open and to keep the platfom up-to-date with V8 engine updates.
 - 2015 a neutral Node.js foundation was created and both the io.js and Node.js communities agreed to work together under the new foundation. Later that year Node.js and io.js merged
 - 2016 io.js effectively dead and recommending users go back to Node.js
