# What is Node.JS

Node.JS is an event-driven, asynchrony javascript backend platform built upon Google's V8 engine.

Node is not a server, it is just a platform on which one can be built

# History of Node.JS

 - Created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and soon sponsered by Joyent
 - In 2011 NPM (Node Package Manager) was introduced to allow easier sharing of modules
 - Also in 2011, Microsoft and Joyent worked together to create a native Windows implementation of Node JS.
 - 2012 Dahl steps aside for NPM creator Isaac Schlueter to take over
 - 2014 Schlueter steps asside handing leadership over to Timothy Fontaine
 - At the end of 2014, io.js, a fork of Node.js, is created due to conflict with how Joyent was governing the platform. io.js main goal was to make governance open and to keep the platfom up-to-date with V8 engine updates.
 - 2015 a neutral Node.js foundation was created and both the io.js and Node.js communities agreed to work together under the new foundation. Later that year Node.js and io.js merged
 - 2016 io.js effectively dead and recommending users go back to Node.js

# Why Node.js?

**Its important to remember that Node.js is not a server, its a platform on which to create servers.**

 - By using non-blocking, asynchronous i/o Node.JS is exceptionally fast
 - Thanks to Angular and other Front End Frameworks, Javascript is no longer just some glue for interactivity, its a First Class language for creating applications. Node.JS makes Javascript a first class language for the back end.
 - Node.JS is easily scaled. The builtin cluster module allows you to share a single port across multiple child processes. 
 - Easy setup. Unlike Apache and the myriad of *.conf files, you deploy node and then your code.
